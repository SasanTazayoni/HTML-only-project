      <strong>Muay Thai</strong> or Thai Boxing is a combat sport from Thailand
      that uses stand-up striking along with various clinching techniques. It's
      sometimes referred to as the 'art of eight limbs' as you use your fists,
      elbows, knees and shins to form one of the most effective and powerful
      martial arts in the world.
