      <strong>Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</strong> focuses on leverage and technique to
      subdue bigger larger opponents. The Martial Art focuses primarily on
      throws/takedowns to joint locks, strangles, and chokes to render an
      attacker unconscious. There is also a large focus on ground fighting to
      achieve this goal.
